# 2010 - The Original Listing Photos
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2308ca02-bac7-4c1b-ba80-454defd66953.jpg)

The full view of the house and front yard. The landscaping, although fairly complex as you will see in later photos, appears reasonably maintained. There is a tree and flagpole that were not there when we purchased.

The best view we have of what the front yard landscaping looked like in its best condition. Take note of the gargoyle perched over the fountain...

The north side of the driveway in full color. There appears to be a tree about 10 feet in from the driveway that was removed before our purchase.

A view of the great room to the right immediately upon entering the home. The home is a multi-level construction with the kitchen and living room on the "main level." This view pretty much sold the house when we walked in. The great room and bedrooms occupy the lower level and the master suite is located on the upper level with an adjacent catwalk overlooking the great room.

The sitting room to the left of the front entry across from the great room. This would become our living room given the close proximity to the kitchen and needing to keep a close eye on the kids.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aeb87d96-40a5-4cea-b73b-9999891b36ef.jpg)

Around the corner and into the dining room.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/36d4b6a8-6dc0-4ea2-912b-5ff759850d7c.jpg)

Full view of the dining room. That light fixture was replaced by the time of our purchase.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/040e705f-c769-4a28-8b6a-8f3291c4f376.jpg)

The kitchen boasts ample counter space but left us thinking more about the possibility of opening up into the dining area for an open concept design and maybe replacing the wall with a breakfast bar into the living room. We'll have to see how the design pans out.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1cf6c278-4050-4514-a9de-607b93b61ff8.jpg)

The dining space in the kitchen with a walk out onto the large deck overlooking the back yard. Lots of natural light coming into this space during the afternoon sun.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8185e995-ec1f-447b-b426-bbf1e17a00ab.jpg)

The master bedroom, located on the second floor, visible from the great room. It is the only room, along with the master bath and closet, on that floor. Another attractive feature of the home - an oasis for the adults!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b405509f-f2d0-4c24-8b5c-4078ba9f5ae5.jpg)

One of the two bedrooms adjacent to the great room. There is a closet adjoining the two rooms as the house was built for a family with twins. A half bath is also in between the bedrooms and accessible via the common space.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/230c82b9-8f94-4c81-9f1e-c92a416f78bc.jpg)

The second bedroom.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/98f92b2c-e741-4864-9398-34a81f1294c3.jpg)

The basement space considered to be a fourth bedroom with a walkout underneath the deck. The basement only spans half of the actual footprint of the house. Given the multi-level layout, it can only feasibly be located under the main level (kitchen and living room). The other half of the basement is a crawl space.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/717fc81e-b0fe-437f-982d-0c3d3f6ef7ae.jpg)

This is where the fun begins! A full bath fully equipped with a hot tub! (Or, a three-quarter bath, depending on whether you consider the hot tub a suitable replacement for a bathtub!) The last two photos are the only two of the basement from the original listing in 2010\. As you will see in later photos, there are many more interesting nuances to this level!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7e5d5a95-7028-4aa0-bda0-9ef2fda5e587.jpg)

A view of the deck and back yard from just outside the walk out from the kitchen. Plenty of entertaining space! The deck had since been repainted by the time we purchased and the trees have grown much larger. This photo also appears to have been from sometime in the Fall.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/22f7c6eb-9b81-4600-9e39-5e14f9e484c9.jpg)

A view of the back side of the house, the basement walk out, and deck from the back yard.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1e376ad3-71f3-4e0a-a606-e483a20e538b.jpg)

The deck, catwalk, and lower fountain from the south side of the house. This is also a nice peek into the back yard.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ed49b6b5-3795-45d6-bca7-d2a2e68cbd85.jpg)

The tri-level water fall and fountain just off of the patio in the back yard. This was connected to the fountain in the front yard forming a water feature that wrapped around half of the house. By the time we purchased, none of this appeared in working order, much of the rock formation had shifted, and the landscaping had grown over. The ponds in the back yard still existed, but for nothing more than holding water and providing residence for a few frogs.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6dfc505b-2447-4c24-846c-a223a266ce34.jpg)

The water feature at night.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bbe7464d-9ab6-469a-a124-1d3e30f7222e.jpg)

A view from the northwest corner of the house into the wooded back yard. Mature trees - another attraction!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/74a35271-c72f-48f2-b643-7b445cc0bfb9.jpg)

The garden shed. It continues to serve its purpose.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/74013ff4-15d7-4ea7-8935-bfb30fea0cbc.jpg)

A fire in the back yard looking toward the house. The tree to the left of the dog was merely a stump when we purchased. No surprise given the perceived condition in this photo.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/11801b7d-1bfc-473f-9ffb-6155bdfadb50.jpg)

A view into the back yard and into the neighbor's yard after a fresh snowfall. Talk about serenity...
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2183e451-95f4-43db-8f19-5ba204d8db1f.jpg)

The front of the house and yard after a fresh snowfall. It's hard to tell, but that driveway isn't as small as it looks...grab a shovel!
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/66b5415d-fc5a-47dc-9eb9-9032f638c6b2.jpg)

A view from the service entry into the garage from the main level (adjacent to the front door). Surprisingly, the basement spans beneath the garage for more subterranian square footage. The garage floor was covered with large mats and kids' rec room flooring when we purchased. Hmm...let the fun begin!
