  On November 13, 2015, we purchased our new home, a Fixer Upper with lots of
  potential. On over three acres of land in a thriving housing market, this was
  not only the the right move to make for our growing young family, but a
  seemingly intelligent financial decision. Built in 1986 and first listed for
  sale in November of 2010 by the original owners, five years later, we would
  become the lucky buyers who saw a diamond in the rough. Only time will tell
  how hard we've been bitten by the HGTV bug, whether it's a house that Mike
  Holmes would approve of, a renovation that would make Chip Gaines or Jonathan
  Scott proud, or an interior design that would inspire even Joanna Gaines or
  Hilary Farr. Project959 is our journey from house to home, possibility to
  reality, a roof over our heads to tranquility and serenity. Or so we hope...
